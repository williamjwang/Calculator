This repository contains files for my first HTML/CSS/JavaScript project, a HTML calculator. I worked on this project during the Fall 2019 HackRU, but I didn't upload it until now (1/10/2020). Feel free to download the files in this repository and try it out!

A web address does not exist for my calculator just yet, but I will try to make one soon with GitHub pages!
